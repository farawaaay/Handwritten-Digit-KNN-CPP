# Handwritten-Digit-KNN-CPP

## What is this

A simple handwritten digit classifier in KNN coded with C++ using the MNIST dataset.

There is no optimization on the algorithm.

## Build & Run

The dataset will be downloaded while building, so you just need:

1. Build it with `make`
2. Run it: `./knn 10 3`

## Debug

Run the whole dataset while debugging is unnessary, so you can build it in debug mode:

1. Build it with `make debug`
2. And run it: `./debug 5 3 6000 2000`
